/**
 * DailyLogEntity represents a daily log entry for a product.
 *
 * Merge strategy: Last-write-wins based on updatedAt. Conflicts are resolved by preferring the most recent update
 * (highest updatedAt timestamp). For critical fields like weightGrams and feedKg, the most recent deviceTimestamp
 * is used if available. Arrays (e.g., medication, symptoms) are deduplicated, and notes are merged with timestamps.
