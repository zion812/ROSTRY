## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ROSTRY team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory (Recommended)**
   - Navigate to the [Security tab](../../security/advisories/new)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send an email to: security@rostry.example.com
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

### What to Include

To help us triage and address the issue quickly, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the app are affected
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or video demonstration
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **Your Environment**: Android version, device model, app version
- **Discovery Details**: How you discovered the vulnerability

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours (acknowledgment)
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days (triage and assessment)
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

### Severity Levels and Response Times

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Fix Target |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach, authentication bypass | 24 hours | 7 days |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure | 48 hours | 14 days |
| **Medium** | Denial of service, information disclosure | 7 days | 30 days |
| **Low** | Minor information leaks, low-impact issues | 14 days | 60 days |

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Validation**: We'll verify the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a patch
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Credit**: We'll publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)
6. **Release**: Security update will be published

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

If you're using ROSTRY, follow these security best practices:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the app
2. **Device Security**: Enable device encryption and screen lock
3. **Biometric Authentication**: Enable biometric authentication in app settings
4. **Network Security**: Use secure Wi-Fi networks; avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations
5. **Permissions**: Review and understand app permissions
6. **Demo Mode**: Remember that demo mode has reduced security features
7. **Report Suspicious Activity**: Report any unusual behavior immediately

### For Developers

If you're contributing to ROSTRY:

1. **Review Security Documentation**: Read `docs/security-encryption.md` thoroughly
2. **Secure Coding**: Follow the security guidelines in our documentation
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
4. **Authentication**: Never bypass authentication or authorization checks
5. **Sensitive Data**: Handle API keys, tokens, and credentials securely
6. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated; monitor for vulnerabilities
7. **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews are required for all PRs
8. **Testing**: Write security test cases for authentication and authorization flows

#### API Key Management

**CRITICAL**: Never commit API keys to version control!

**Setup Process**:
1. Copy `local.properties.template` to `local.properties`
2. Add your actual API keys to `local.properties`
3. Verify `local.properties` is in `.gitignore` (already configured)

**Google Maps API Key**:
- Stored in `local.properties` as `MAPS_API_KEY`
- Accessed via BuildConfig: `BuildConfig.MAPS_API_KEY`
- Injected into AndroidManifest via manifestPlaceholders
- **Never hardcode** API keys in source code

**API Key Restrictions**:
- Restrict Maps API key to your Android app's package name and SHA-1 certificate fingerprint
- Use separate keys for development and production
- Enable only required APIs (Maps SDK, Places API)
- Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud Console
- Regularly rotate API keys

**Example local.properties**:
```properties
MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Security Features

ROSTRY implements multiple layers of security to protect user data:

### Data Protection

- **Database Encryption**: SQLCipher encryption for local Room database
- **Encrypted Preferences**: Sensitive preferences stored using EncryptedSharedPreferences
- **Secure Session Management**: Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- **Biometric Authentication**: Optional fingerprint/face unlock
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive data masked in logs and screenshots

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Only**: All network communication over TLS 1.2+
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents MITM attacks (production builds)
- **Secure Headers**: Proper security headers in API requests
- **Request Signing**: Signed requests for sensitive operations

### Access Control

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Three user roles with distinct permissions
  - General User: Basic social features
  - Farmer: Full farm management + marketplace
  - Enthusiast: Social + limited marketplace access
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Server-side authorization for Firestore and Storage
- **Cloud Functions Security**: Authenticated and authorized cloud function calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and abuse

### Audit and Monitoring

- **Audit Logging**: Critical operations logged for accountability
- **Transfer Audit Trail**: Complete history of fowl ownership transfers
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring for unusual patterns
- **Crash Reporting**: Firebase Crashlytics with anonymized data

### Code Security

- **ProGuard/R8**: Code obfuscation in release builds
- **SafetyNet**: Device integrity verification
- **Root Detection**: Warning for rooted devices
- **Tamper Detection**: Checks for app modifications

---

## Known Security Considerations

### Demo Mode

**Important**: Demo mode has reduced security for ease of testing:
- Pre-populated demo credentials
- Simplified authentication flows
- Mock data without full encryption
- **Do not use demo mode with real user data**

### Development vs Production

Security configurations differ between environments:

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Certificate Pinning | Disabled | Enabled |
| Network Logging | Verbose | Minimal |
| Debug Flags | Enabled | Disabled |
| ProGuard | Disabled | Enabled |
| SafetyNet | Bypass | Enforced |

### Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update dependencies with known vulnerabilities. See our dependency policy in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
