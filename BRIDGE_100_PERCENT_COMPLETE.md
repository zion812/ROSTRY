### **18. FarmerHomeViewModel.kt + Entity + Worker** ✅ COMPLETE

#### **A. FarmerHomeViewModel.kt**
**Added to UiState:**
```kotlin
val productsReadyToListCount: Int = 0 // Farm-marketplace bridge
```

**Updated State Construction:**
```kotlin
productsReadyToListCount = snapshot?.productsReadyToListCount ?: 0
```

**Result:** Home screen displays real-time count from dashboard snapshot

---

#### **B. NewFarmMonitoringEntities.kt (FarmerDashboardSnapshotEntity)**
**Added Field:**
```kotlin
val productsReadyToListCount: Int = 0 
// Farm-marketplace bridge: Products with growth records and not in quarantine
```

**Purpose:** Persists the count in weekly dashboard snapshot for performance

---

#### **C. FarmPerformanceWorker.kt**
**Added Calculation Logic:**

```kotlin
// Farm-marketplace bridge: Products ready to list
// Count products that have growth records and are NOT in active quarantine
val allGrowthRecords = growthRecordDao.getAllByFarmer(farmerId).first()
val productsWithGrowth = allGrowthRecords.map { it.productId }.distinct()
val activeQuarantineProducts = quarantineRecordDao.getAllActiveForFarmer(farmerId).first()
    .map { it.productId }
    .toSet()
val productsReadyToListCount = productsWithGrowth.count { !activeQuarantineProducts.contains(it) }
```

**Logic:**
1. Get all growth records for farmer
2. Extract distinct product IDs
3. Get all products in active quarantine
4. Count products with growth records BUT NOT in quarantine
5. Store in snapshot for fast dashboard access

**Performance:**
- Runs weekly via WorkManager
- Cached in database snapshot
- No real-time queries on home screen load
- Efficient set-based filtering
