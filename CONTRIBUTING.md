## üìù Quick Contribution Checklist
- [ ] Read the **[Quick Start](../QUICK_START.md)** and run the app
- [ ] Create a feature branch: `feat/<short-description>`
- [ ] Follow **[CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md)** conventions
- [ ] Write or update **tests** and **docs**
- [ ] Run `./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt test` locally
- [ ] Submit a PR using the provided template

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and open in Android Studio (latest stable version).
2. **Install prerequisites**:
   - JDK 17
   - Android SDKs as required by `gradle.properties`
   - NDK if working on native code
3. **Configure Firebase**: Download and place `google-services.json` in `app/` directory.
4. **Sync Gradle**: Allow Android Studio to sync dependencies automatically.
5. **Run the app**: Build and run in debug mode to ensure everything works.

See [developer-onboarding.md](docs/developer-onboarding.md) for comprehensive onboarding. For a fast start see [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) and handy commands in [CHEAT_SHEET.md](CHEAT_SHEET.md).

## Code of Conduct (Summary)
We are committed to a **welcoming, inclusive, harassment-free** community.

- Be respectful and constructive
- No harassment or discrimination
- Report unacceptable behavior privately (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))

By contributing you agree to follow these guidelines. The Code of Conduct is maintained here as a concise summary to reduce redundancy.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use GitHub Flow with feature branches:

- **main**: Always stable and deployable
- **Feature branches**: Create from main with descriptive names:
  - `feat/add-payment-gateway` - New features
  - `fix/sync-crash` - Bug fixes
  - `docs/update-architecture` - Documentation updates
  - `refactor/simplify-viewmodel` - Code refactoring
  - `test/add-repository-tests` - Test additions

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add multi-step wizard for product creation

- Implement 4-step wizard (BASICS ‚Üí DETAILS ‚Üí MEDIA ‚Üí REVIEW)
- Add progress indicator and navigation controls
- Include inline validation for each step

Closes #123
```

Format: `<type>: <subject>` followed by optional body and footer.

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

## Code Style

Follow `CODE_STYLE.md` for detailed conventions.

### Key Principles

- **Kotlin idioms**: Use data classes, sealed classes, and extension functions appropriately.
- **Null safety**: Avoid `!!`; use safe calls (`?.`) and require checks.
- **Feature organization**: Package by feature, not by layer.
- **Immutability**: Prefer `val` over `var`; use immutable data structures.
- **Compose best practices**: Stateless composables, proper state hoisting.

### Examples

**Good**:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ProductCard(
    product: Product,
    onProductClick: (String) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    Card(modifier = modifier.clickable { onProductClick(product.id) }) {
        // ... content
    }
}
```

**Bad**:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ProductCard(product: Product) {
    var clicked by remember { mutableStateOf(false) } // State should be hoisted
    Card(modifier = Modifier.clickable { clicked = true }) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **Unit tests**: Required for ViewModels, repositories, and utility functions.
- **Instrumentation tests**: Required for critical user flows and database migrations.
- **Test naming**: Use descriptive names that explain what is being tested.

See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for comprehensive testing approach.

### Example Test Names

```kotlin
@Test
fun `createProduct with valid data should return Success`() { }

@Test
fun `applyFilters with empty query should return all products`() { }

@Test
fun `wizard nextStep with invalid data should show validation errors`() { }
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
./gradlew test

# Instrumented tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "ProductRepositoryTest"
```

---

## Documentation Requirements

All code changes must include appropriate documentation.

### When to Document

**Required**:
- All public classes, interfaces, and functions
- Complex algorithms or non-obvious logic
- All parameters and return values
- Exceptions that can be thrown

**Optional**:
- Private functions (unless complex)
- Self-explanatory code

### KDoc Standards

Use **KDoc** (Kotlin Documentation) for inline API documentation:

```kotlin
/**
 * Creates a new product and stores it locally and remotely.
 *
 * Validates product data, assigns timestamps, stores in Room database,
 * and queues for Firestore sync.
 *
 * @param product The product to create (with ID and sellerId set)
 * @return Result.Success with product ID, or Result.Error with message
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if validation fails
 * @see Product
 * @see getProducts
 */
suspend fun createProduct(product: Product): Result<String>
```

### Documentation Quality

- **Be clear**: Write for readers unfamiliar with implementation
- **Be concise**: Don't repeat what's obvious from signatures
- **Be specific**: Provide concrete examples for complex APIs
- **Be accurate**: Keep docs in sync with code

### Generating Documentation

```bash
# Generate HTML documentation
./gradlew :app:dokkaHtml

# View generated docs
open app/build/dokka/html/index.html
```

**Complete KDoc Guide**: See [docs/api-documentation.md](docs/api-documentation.md). Also follow our [Documentation Standards](docs/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md).

### Required CI Checks

All PRs must pass:
- Lint checks (ktlint, detekt)
- Unit tests
- Build verification
- Code coverage threshold

## Code Review

### What to Expect

- Reviews typically completed within 2 business days
- Constructive feedback focused on code quality and maintainability

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

ROSTRY uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Automated Checks

Every pull request triggers:
- **Linting**: ktlint, detekt, Android lint
- **Build**: Debug and release variants
- **Tests**: Unit tests with coverage reports
- **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Quality** (<3 min): Linting and static analysis
2. **Build** (<5 min): Compile and generate APKs
3. **Test** (<10 min): Run unit and instrumentation tests
4. **Deploy** (main branch only): Firebase App Distribution

### Viewing Pipeline Results

- Check the **Actions** tab in GitHub
- PR checks must pass before merging
- Failed checks block merge until fixed

### Local Pipeline Testing

Run checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Lint
./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt

# Build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Test
./gradlew test

# All checks
./gradlew check
```

**Complete CI/CD Documentation**: See [docs/ci-cd.md](docs/ci-cd.md)

## Security

Security is critical for ROSTRY. Please follow these guidelines.

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities!

**Private Reporting Process**:
1. Go to the **Security** tab in GitHub
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Include steps to reproduce if possible
5. Suggest a fix if you have one

**Response Timeline**:
- Initial acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
- Status update: Within 7 days
- Fix and disclosure: Coordinated with reporter

**Full Security Policy**: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

**Never Commit**:
- API keys or secrets
