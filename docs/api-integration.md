# API Integration & Network Layer

Networking stack, service interfaces, and reliability patterns.

## Configuration

- `NetworkModule.kt` and `HttpModule.kt` configure Retrofit, OkHttp, converters, and interceptors.
- Interceptors for auth headers, logging, and error normalization.

## DTO Mapping

- Map request/response DTOs to domain entities; isolate API models from Room.

## Rate Limiting & Usage

- `RateLimitEntity` with `DataUsageTracker.kt` enforces per-endpoint limits and budgets.

## Network Quality

- `NetworkQualityMonitor.kt` observes connectivity and bandwidth; backs adaptive strategies.

## Offline-First

- Room as source of truth; sync jobs reconcile remote changes.

## Errors & Retries

- Categorize (network, server, client) and backoff policies.

## Security

- TLS best practices, optional certificate pinning, request signing for sensitive calls.

## Testing

- Mock services, contract tests, and snapshot tests for stability.

## Firebase Functions

- Integrate callable/endpoints for server-side logic where applicable.
