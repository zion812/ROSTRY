# ROSTRY Documentation Index

The documentation folder consolidates deep-dive guides to help new and existing contributors understand the system architecture, feature domains, and operational requirements.

## Contents
- `architecture.md` — High-level overview of layers, navigation, background jobs, and integrations.
- `transfer-workflow.md` — Ownership transfer lifecycle, verifications, disputes, automation, and testing tips.
- `analytics-dashboard.md` — Role-specific dashboards, data pipelines, workers, and extension ideas.
- `social-platform.md` — Community features (feed, messaging, groups, moderation) and background automation.
- `data-contracts.md` — Room schema highlights, Firebase collections, Retrofit APIs, and validation utilities.
- `testing-operations.md` — Testing strategy, security practices, operational procedures, and incident response.

## How to Use
1. Start with `architecture.md` for overall context.
2. Refer to feature guides when working on domain-specific tasks.
3. Consult `data-contracts.md` when updating database or remote schemas.
4. Align with `testing-operations.md` before release or security-sensitive changes.

Keep the docs up to date by mirroring code changes and capturing architecture decisions in separate ADRs when appropriate.
