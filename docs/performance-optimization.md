# Performance Optimization

This document describes strategies, benchmarks, and monitoring guidance for maintaining excellent performance in the ROSTRY Android app.

## Strategies
- Database: use indexed queries, paging, and batch operations; avoid N+1 patterns.
- Network: enable caching, compress payloads, batch requests on poor networks, exponential backoff.
- Images: compress uploads, resize on device, leverage memory/disk caches.
- WorkManager: defer heavy work to charging/unmetered conditions if possible.

## Monitoring
- Use Firebase Performance traces for key user journeys.
- Track cold/warm start times and frame rendering metrics.
- Capture custom metrics for sync cycles and database query latencies.

## New Utilities
- `DatabaseOptimizer` in `app/src/main/java/com/rio/rostry/utils/performance/DatabaseOptimizer.kt`
- `NetworkOptimizer` in `app/src/main/java/com/rio/rostry/utils/network/NetworkOptimizer.kt`
- `MemoryManager` in `app/src/main/java/com/rio/rostry/utils/performance/MemoryManager.kt`
- `PerformanceMonitor` in `app/src/main/java/com/rio/rostry/monitoring/PerformanceMonitor.kt`

## Benchmarking
- Establish baselines on mid-range devices.
- Use repeatable datasets and disable animations.
- Fail PRs if regressions exceed thresholds.

## Maintenance
- Periodically compact/cleanup the database.
- Review slow queries and add indices as needed.
- Tune image/cache sizes per device memory class.
